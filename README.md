AN APPLICATION BASED HARDWARE SYSTEM FOR GRAINS STORAGE MANAGEMENT  AS WELL AS SOIL AND CROP MONITERING.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1. Untimely wastage of grains due to inefficient storage management in warehouses .
2. PRODUCTION IMPROVEMENT OF CROPS USING REAL TIME SOIL MONITERING
3. REAL ALERT SYSTEM TO FARMERS ABOUT THEIR CROPS  CONDITIONS

OUR SOLUTION:

1. AN APPLICATION BASED HARDWARE SYSTEM FOR GRAINS STORAGE MANAGEMENT  AS WELL AS SOIL AND CROP MONITERING.
2. THE HARDWARE PART CONSISTS OF VARIOUS SENSORS TO DETECT THE SOIL CONDITIONS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY OF THE SOIL FOR CROPS MONITERING AND FURTHER DISPLAY ON THE APPLICATION.
3. AUTOMATED IRRIGATION SYSTEM BASED ON CROP REQUIREMENTS.
4. USE OF DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING FOR ANALYSING THE HEALTH OF PLANTS AND TO ALERT THE FARMERS ABOUT THE SAME.
5. AN APPLICATION FOR EFFICIENT STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF GRAINS IN WAREHOUSES TO FACILITATE THE FARMERS AND FCCI OFFICIALS TO KEEP TRACK OF THE STORAGE AREAS.
6. QUANTATIVE MANAGEMENT BY TRANSFER OF SURPLUS/EXCESS FOOD GRAINS TO THE NEAREST WAREHOUSES.
